  <i>The aim of the project is to develop a C program that allows the user to play the ‚Äúdomino game‚Äù with simple rules. The game can be played between real opponents (people) or between a real player and the computer (we will simulate an intelligent behavior of the computer through rules implemented in code).</i>

# Git and Code Patterns

- Please use the correct [commit types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/legend80s/commit-msg-linter/master/assets/demo-4-compressed.png) bellow before sending the file to github
  - feat: a new feature
  - fix: a bug fix
  - refactor: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - <strong>EXAMPLE</strong>: "feat: add some new feature", the phrase should always be on infinitive 

- For code writing we will use:
  - [camelCase](https://codeflavor.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/camelcase-o-que-e-porque-usar/)
  - all functions, variables, etc... must be in <strong>english</strong>
