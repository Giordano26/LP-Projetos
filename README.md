 üÇë "C" Domino Game üÇë
</h1>

<p align="center">
  <i>The aim of the project is to develop a C program that allows the user to play the ‚Äúdomino game‚Äù with simple rules. The game can be played between real opponents (people) or between a real player and the computer (we will simulate an intelligent behavior of the computer through rules implemented in code).</i>

# Running the app

* <Strong>Soon</strong>

# Requirements

### Step 1      
* <p><s>The system should be capable to set up the pieces of the game with the correct numbering</s></p>
* <p><s>The system should allow the player to mix up the domino pieces</s></p>
* <p><s>The system should allow the player to organize the domino pieces (in the correct sequence) to play again.</s></p>
* <p><s>The system should be capable to show all domino pieces on the screen (in text or graphic mode)</s></p>

### Step 2      <Strong>!!!!DONE!!!!<Strong>
* <p><s>The system must be easyly refactored and posterior code modifications shouldn't impact on further modules</s></p>
* <p><s>The system must have different ways to show game options (multiples menus</s></p>
### Step 3
* <p><s>The system should let the user dertemine how many players will play the game. Minimum of One and Maximum of Two players</s></p>
* <p><s>The system should create a game table after the domino's pieces between the players</s></p>
* <p><s>The system should let the user distribute the domino's pieces among players<\s></p>
* <p><s>The system should let the user start a game</s></p>
* <p><s>The system should let the user pick "Buy" a piece</s></p>
* <p>The system must verify if the player's last move is valid (wrong positioning and etc)</p>
### Step 4
* <p><s>The system should let the user  see their own pieces on screen (text mode or graphic) during in game time</s></p>
* <p><s>The system should allow the user to hide their own pieces from other players</s></p>
* <p>The system should let the user  end the match</p>
* <p><s>The system should let the user visualize the rules in game time</s></p>
* <p><s>The system should let the user buy pieces in game time</s></p>
### Step 5
* <p>The system should let the user save a game on a specific archive in order to continue afterwards. Even if the "game process" is terminated</p>
* <p>The system should let the user load a "save game archive" from its own computer </p>
### Step 6
* <p>When solo game is selected, the system should be able to simulate a intelligent pattern, simillar to an A.I, by the means of the rules implementation on code</p>

# Git and Code Patterns

- Please use the correct [commit types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/legend80s/commit-msg-linter/master/assets/demo-4-compressed.png) bellow before sending the file to github
  - feat: a new feature
  - fix: a bug fix
  - refactor: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - <strong>EXAMPLE</strong>: "feat: add some new feature", the phrase should always be on infinitive 

- For code writing we will use:
  - [camelCase](https://codeflavor.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/camelcase-o-que-e-porque-usar/)
  - all functions, variables, etc... must be in <strong>english</strong>
